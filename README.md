"Construction-Hazard-Detection" is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance safety on construction sites. By leveraging the YOLO model for object detection, it identifies potential hazards such as:

- Workers without helmets
- Workers without safety vests
- Workers near machinery or vehicles
- Workers in restricted areas, restricted areas will be automatically generated by computing and clustering the coordinates of safety cones.

Post-processing algorithms further improve detection accuracy. The system is built for real-time deployment, offering instant analysis and alerts for identified hazards.

Additionally, the system integrates AI recognition results in real-time via a web interface. It can send notifications and real-time on-site images through messaging apps like LINE, Messenger, WeChat, and Telegram for prompt alerts and reminders. The system also supports multiple languages, enabling users to receive notifications and interact with the interface in their preferred language. Supported languages include:

- 🇹🇼 Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)
- 🇨🇳 Simplified Chinese (Mainland China)
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇹🇭 Thai
- 🇻🇳 Vietnamese
- 🇮🇩 Indonesian

This multi-language support makes the system accessible to a global audience, improving usability across different regions.

> **TODO**: Add support for WhatsApp notifications, and utilise Line Message API.

## Hazard Detection Examples

Below are examples of real-time hazard detection by the system:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <!-- Example 1: Workers without Helmets or Safety Vests -->
  <div style="text-align: center; flex-basis: 33%;">
    <img src="./assets/images/demo/person_did_not_wear_safety_vest.png" alt="Workers without helmets or safety vests" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; object-fit: cover;">
    <p>Workers without Helmets or Safety Vests</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Example 2: Workers near Machinery or Vehicles -->
  <div style="text-align: center; flex-basis: 33%;">
    <img src="./assets/images/demo/person_near_machinery.jpg" alt="Workers near machinery or vehicles" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; object-fit: cover;">
    <p>Workers near Machinery or Vehicles</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Example 3: Workers in Restricted Areas -->
  <div style="text-align: center; flex-basis: 33%;">
    <img src="./assets/images/demo/persons_in_restricted_zones.jpg" alt="Workers in restricted areas" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; object-fit: cover;">
    <p>Workers in Restricted Areas</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Usage

Before running the application, you need to configure the system by specifying the details of the video streams and other parameters in a YAML configuration file. An example configuration file `configuration.yaml` should look like this:

```yaml
# This is a list of video configurations
- video_url: "rtsp://example1.com/stream"  # URL of the video
  image_name: "cam1"  # Name of the image
  label: "label1"  # Label of the video
  model_key: "yolo11n"  # Model key for the video
  line_token: "token1"  # Line token for notification
  run_local: True  # Run object detection locally
  language: "en" # Set language to English
- video_url: "rtsp://example2.com/stream"
  image_name: "cam2"
  label: "label2"
  model_key: "yolo11n"
  line_token: "token2"
  run_local: True
  language: "zh-TW"
```

Each object in the array represents a video stream configuration with the following fields:

- `video_url`: The URL of the live video stream. This can include:
   - Surveillance streams
   - RTSP streams
   - Secondary streams
   - YouTube videos or live streams
   - Discord streams
- `image_name`: The name assigned to the image or camera.
- `label`: The label assigned to the video stream.
- `model_key`: The key identifier for the machine learning model to use.
- `line_token`: The LINE messaging API token for sending notifications.  For information on how to obtain a LINE token, please refer to [line_notify_guide_en](docs/en/line_notify_guide_en.md).
- `run_local`: Boolean value indicating whether to run object detection locally.
- `language`: The language for notifications and system messages.

   ### Usage for Docker

   To run the hazard detection system, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get the system up and running:

   1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/yihong1120/Construction-Hazard-Detection.git
      ```

   2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
      ```
      cd Construction-Hazard-Detection
      ```

   3. Build and run the services using Docker Compose:
      ```bash
      docker-compose up --build
      ```

   4. To run the main application with a specific configuration file, use the following command:
      ```bash
      docker-compose run main-application python main.py --config /path/in/container/configuration.yaml
      ```
      Replace `/path/in/container/configuration.yaml` with the actual path to your configuration file inside the container.

   5. To stop the services, use the following command:
      ```bash
      docker-compose down
      ```

      sudo systemctl start mysql.service
      ```

      For others, you can download and install MySQL that works in your operation system in this [link](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

   5. Start user management API:
      ```bash
      gunicorn -w 1 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 "examples.user_management.app:user-managements-app"
      ```

   6. Run object detection API:

      ```

   7. Run the main application with a specific configuration file:
      ```bash
      python3 main.py --config /path/to/your/configuration.yaml
      ```
      Replace `/path/to/your/configuration.yaml` with the actual path to your configuration file.

   8. Start the streaming web service:

      For linux users:
      ```bash
      gunicorn -w 1 -k eventlet -b 127.0.0.1:8002 "examples.streaming_web.app:streaming-web-app"
      ```

      For windows users:
      ```
      waitress-serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8002 "examples.streaming_web.app:streaming-web-app"
      ```

</details>

## Additional Information

- The system logs are available within the Docker container and can be accessed for debugging purposes.
- The output images with detections (if enabled) will be saved to the specified output path.
- Notifications will be sent through LINE messaging API during the specified hours if hazards are detected.

### Notes

- Ensure that the `Dockerfile` is present in the root directory of the project and is properly configured as per your application's requirements.
- The `-p 8080:8080` flag maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your host machine, allowing you to access the application via the host's IP address and port number.

For more information on Docker usage and commands, refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).
